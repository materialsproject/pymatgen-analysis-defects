# ## Read a single Harmonic Defect
# 
# We can parse an sorted list of directories with `HarmonicDefect.from_directories`.
# This will look into each directory for a `vasprun.xml` file from which the structures and energies will be extracted.
# 
# The different constructors for `HarmonicDefect` all accept a list of sources where the energies and structures come from.
# The relaxed structure will be taken from the `relaxed_index` entry from this list and the electronic structure from this entry will be parsed to help identify the defect band in the band structure.
#

# Note that `HarmonicDefect.defect_band` consists of multiple states presented as `(iband, ikpt, ispin)` index tuples, if `defect_band` was not provided to the constructor, the `relaxed_index` entry in the directory list will be checked for a Procar file, which will be parsed to give the "best guess" of the defect state in the band structure.
# The band index is automatically determined by the inverse participation ratio.
# Note that the defect state reports the "most-localized" bands at each k-point so it is possible for the band index of the defect band to change for different kpoint indices `ikpt`.
# 
# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><b>Note:</b> The automated defect state identification is still in testing you can provide the `defect_band` manually to over-ride the automatic behavior if you notice any issues.
# Please report any issues you encounter to the github issue tracker.
