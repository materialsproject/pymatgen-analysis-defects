# This makes some of the accounting logic a bit harder since we will probably
# just have one concrete ``Defect`` class so you can write custom multiplicity functions
# but it makes the implementation of defect complexes trivial.
# i.e. each defect will be defined by a structure and a collection of ``DefectSite``s
