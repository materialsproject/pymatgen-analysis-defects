@article{hohenberg_inhomogeneous_1964,
   abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 2/3.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods. An appendix deals with a further correction for systems with short-wavelength density oscillations.},

   abstract = {<p>Recent developments in theoretical techniques have significantly improved the predictive power of density-functional-based calculations. In this review, we discuss how such advancements have enabled improved understanding of native point defects in GaN. We review the methodologies for the calculation of point defects, and discuss how techniques for overcoming the band-gap problem of density functional theory affect native defect calculations. In particular, we examine to what extent calculations performed with semilocal functionals (such as the generalized gradient approximation), combined with correction schemes, can produce accurate results. The properties of vacancy, interstitial, and antisite defects in GaN are described, as well as their interaction with common impurities. We also connect the first-principles results to experimental observations, and discuss how native defects and their complexes impact the performance of nitride devices. Overall, we find that lower-cost functionals, such as the generalized gradient approximation, combined with band-edge correction schemes can produce results that are qualitatively correct. However, important physics may be missed in some important cases, particularly for optical transitions and when carrier localization occurs.</p>},

   abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method ͑direct inversion in the iterative subspace͒ to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N atoms 3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ''metric'' and a special ''precon-ditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N atoms 2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach N atoms . We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP ͑Vienna ab initio simulation package͒. The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems ͑liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors͒ and turned out to be very reliable. ͓S0163-1829͑96͒00440-7͔},
