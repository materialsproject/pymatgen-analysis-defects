    "A persistent challenge with organizing computational defect data is the ambiguity with which a defect simulation is defined.\n",
    "The standard practice is to simulate the isolated defects by using a larger simulation to create an isolated defect and then using charge-state corrections to approximate the properties of a defect in the dilute limit.\n",
    "This means that the same defect can be simulated with different simulation cells.\n",
    "Ideally, if you want to build a computational defects database that lasts many years, you cannot rely on user-supplied provenance to aggregate the data.\n",
    "You must have the external method for tracking whether two calculations are for the same defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Note:</b> This is only important for large database building. For an example of this please see the Materials Project battery database which only relies on structure matching to arrive at the list of insertion electrodes.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A core concept in this package is that a defect is defined independently of the simulation cell.\n",
    "All of the information about which defect we are simulating is captured by the `Defect` object.\n",
    "A point defect is defined by the Wigner-Seitz unit cell representation of the bulk material stored as a `structure` attribute and a `site` attribute that indicates where the defect is in the unit cell.\n",
    "Different kinds of point defects all subclass the `Defect` objects which gives easy access to functions such as generating a cubic simulation supercell.\n",
    "As along as the database or any algorithm keeps track of this `Defect` object, you can just use simple structure matching to find out if two simulations represent the same defect.\n"
