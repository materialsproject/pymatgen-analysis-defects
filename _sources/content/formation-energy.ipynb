    "# Formation Energy Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "The formation energy diagram is perhaps the most important tool in analyzing the defect properties.\n",
    "It informs both the likelihood of a defect to form and transition level where the charge state of the defect changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formation energy of a defect is determined by the chemical potential of everything that goes into forming the defect.\n",
    "While all of the different chemical potentials are interconnected, it is conceptually easier to separate them into two groups: the chemical potential of the elements and the chemical potential of the electron.\n",
    "The chemical potential of the electron, often called the *Fermi level*, accounts for how all of the external conditions, including the presence of other defects, affect the thermodynamics of adding or removing an electron from the defect.\n",
    "Since the electrons in the system can be manipulated after the defect is formed, the *Fermi level* is often considered a free variable and is shown as the x-axis in the formation energy diagram.\n",
    "The chemical potentials of the different atoms added or removed to form the defect determine are less dynamic and assumed to be fixed after the defect is formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression for the formation energy of a defect is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E^f[X^q] = E_{\\rm tot}[X^q] - E_{\\rm tot}[{\\rm bulk}] + \\sum_i n_i \\mu_i + qE_{\\rm F} + \\Delta^q \\, ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E^f[X^q]$ is the formation energy of the defect, $E_{\\rm tot}[X^q]$ is the total energy of the defect, $E_{\\rm tot}[{\\rm bulk}]$ is the total energy of the bulk, $n_i$ is the number of atoms of type $i$ in the defect, $\\mu_i$ is the chemical potential of atom type $i$, $q$ is the charge of the defect, $E_{\\rm F}$ is the Fermi level, and $\\Delta^q$ is finite-size correction which we have to add to account for image effects of simulating the defect in a periodic simulation cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schematic of the formation energy diagram for the $q=0$ and $q=-1$ charge states of a hypothetical defect is shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "This method requires calculating the the long range term from the Coulomb interaction and a short range term from the electrostatic potential in the `LOCPOT` file.\n",
    "While the final result of the finite-size correction is just a single number $\\Delta^q$ for each charge state, the intermediate results can still be analyzed.\n",
    "This is still useful, since the defect position is automatically determined from the `LOCPOT` files alone, to check the planar-averaged potential plots to make sure that the defect is indeed in the correct position.\n",
    "This will be evident if the planar-averaged potential difference is peaked at the two ends of the plot since the automatically determined defect position is chosen as the origin of the plot.\n",
    "The short range contribution is set to zero far away from the defect, which is accomplished by average the planar electrostatic potential far away from the defect in the `sampling region` shown below.\n",
    "The intermediate analysis (planar-averaged potentials) for calculating the Freysoldt correction for each of the the three lattice directions is shown below.\n"
