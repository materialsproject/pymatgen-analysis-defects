# Summary

Point defects can often be the determining factor in the properties of semiconductor and optoelectronic materials [@CGWalle_defects_RMP].
Simulation of point defects is one of the most complex workflows in computational materials science, involving extensive pre- and post-processing of the structural and electronic structure data.
Multiple software packages exist to automate the simulation of point defects [@Broberg2018,@Kumagai2021,@Huang2022,], however, there is a lack of a code that focuses on:

1. Integration with standardized high-throughput workflow frameworks.
2. Building large, persistent databases of point defects that are extensible to new calculations over time.

Since the combinatorics of point defects in crystalline materials can be extremely large, it is important to have a software package that can be easily integrated into high-throughput workflows to manage these complex calculations.
Additionally, a well-known problem in the simulation of point defects is the fact that current structure optimization techniques can miss the ground state structure based on the initial guess in a sizable minority of cases, so the ability to easily re-visit and re-optimize structures is crucial to building a reliable database of point defects.
Towards that end, we have developed a Python package, `pymatgen-analysis-defect`, and integrated it with the popular `atomate2` workflow framework to provide a complete set of tools for simulating, analyzing, and managing the results of point defect calculations.

Since the ability to revisit calculations is crucial to building a reliable database, but user tagging of calculations is inconsistent, especially in a high-throughput context, we have codified a structure-only definition of point defects that can be used to aggregate the results of multiple calculations of the same defect.
This allows for the creation of a database of point defects that can be easily extended to new calculations over time.
In addition to the focus on database building, we have also implemented several tools for analyzing quantum recombination in defects, these include:

1. Calculation of the optical transition between states under the single-particle approximation.
2. Calculation of the non-radiative recombination using the `nonrad` code [@turiansky_nonrad_2021].

Details of the implementation and tutorials for using the different parts of the package are provided at:

https://materialsproject.github.io/pymatgen-analysis-defects/intro.html

A basic example of integration with the `atomate2` workflow framework is provided below:

```python
from atomate2.vasp.flows.defect import FormationEnergyMaker
from jobflow import Flow
from pymatgen.analysis.defects.generators import generate_all_native_defects
from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester

with MPRester() as mpr:
    chgcar = mpr.get_charge_density_from_material_id("mp-804")


maker = FormationEnergyMaker()
jobs = []
for defect in generate_all_native_defects(chgcar):
    jobs.append(maker.make(defect))
flow = Flow(jobs)
```

The code above will generate a `Flow` object that contains all of the instructions to dynamically create all of the required defect calculations, which can be sent to the job manager on HPC to be executed.
In the code above, we query the materials project database for the charge density object which contains the information about the bulk structure as well as the electronic charge density.
Using the `generate_all_native_defects` function, we can generate a list of all of the native point defects for this structure.

Each defect object can be passed to the `FormationEnergyMaker` object to generate a `Job` object that contains all of the instructions to perform the defect calculation.


# Statement of need

Due to the large simulation cell and the higher-cost density functionals required for defect simulations, the computational cost of defect calculations is often orders of magnitude higher than that of bulk calculations.
As such, managing and curating the results of the defect calculations generated by a single user has to potential to save a significant amount of computational resources.
Moreover, eventually building a high-quality, persistent defects database will significantly reduce the computational cost of defect calculations for the entire community.
The present software package is designed to facilitate both of these goals.
