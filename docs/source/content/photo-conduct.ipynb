    "# Photo Conductivity\n",
    "\n",
    "When the electronic state of the defect interacts with radiation, carriers can be excited to the conduction band. This is called photoconductivity. To help elucidate how likely a defect is to cause photoconductivity, we can look at the band-decomposed contribution to the frequency-dependent dielectric function.\n",
    "Here we have replicated `VASP`'s density-density optical response calculated in the independent-particle picture in the `pymatgen.io.vasp.optics` module, and a allowed users to control which dipole matrix elements are accounted for by masking the dipole matrix elements stored in the `WAVEDER` file and manipulate the Fermi level to populate or depopulate the defect state.\n",
    "This essentially allows us to calculate the optical response for (defect)→(conduction band) and (valence band)→(defect) transitions in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how `VASP` handles optical response, see the [VASP documentation](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/LOPTICS).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on how the python code works, please see the documentation for the `pymatgen.io.vasp.optics` module.\n"
