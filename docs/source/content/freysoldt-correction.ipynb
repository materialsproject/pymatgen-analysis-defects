    "# Freysoldt Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical tool for performing Freysoldt correction is the `sxdefectalign` tool shipped as part of the `SPHInX` DFT code.\n",
    "The standalone download for the tool can be found [here](https://sxrepo.mpie.de/projects/sphinx-add-ons/files) and the source code for the `SPHInX` package can be found [here](https://sxrepo.mpie.de).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate a python implementation that removes the remaining parts of the `sxdefectalign` that requires user inputs:\n",
    "1. Identification of the position of the defect in the simulation cell.\n",
    "2. Identification of the plateau for potential alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document serves as both a validation of the python code against `sxdefectalign` as well as a tutorials for users of `sxdefectalign` to migrate their workflow over to the pure python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the Freysoldt corrections energies we only need to use the LOCPOT files from the DFT calculations and the charge state for the model charge.\n",
    "We will use our python code to obtain the defect position in the simulation cell and potential alignment and use those as inputs in the `sxdefectalign` tool to compare the results against our pure python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data from the DFT calculations as well as the script used to generate the correction data can be found in the `/tests/test_files/v_N_GaN`.\n"
